### Deployment History

Production deployments are tracked through GitHub Releases.

Each deployment automatically creates a release tag:

production-${github.run_number}

Deployment history is available in the GitHub Releases page and can be used for rollback selection.

Retention policy:

* Keep the latest 5 production releases
* Older releases may be manually archived or removed by maintainers

Rollback workflow accepts a release tag and redeploys the selected release.
