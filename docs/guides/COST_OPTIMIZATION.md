# Cost Optimization & Resource Management

## Overview

This guide outlines the cost optimization strategies and resource management practices adopted by NexaSphere to keep infrastructure costs reasonable as the platform scales. Our target is to reduce overall costs by 20% while maintaining performance and reliability.

## 1. Resource Tagging Strategy

All AWS resources must be tagged for cost allocation. This ensures that every expense can be traced back to its specific project, environment, and team.

**Required Tags:**

- `Environment`: `production` | `staging` | `development`
- `Project`: `NexaSphere`
- `CostCenter`: e.g., `DevOps`, `Backend`, `Frontend`
- `ManagedBy`: `Terraform` (for IaC provisioned resources)

## 2. Right-Sizing and Spot Instances

- **Right-Sizing**: Ensure that instances are sized appropriately based on CPU and memory utilization. AWS Compute Optimizer should be reviewed weekly.
- **Spot Instances**: Use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads, background jobs, and worker nodes to save up to 80% on compute costs.
- **Reserved Instances**: For stable database workloads and core platform services, commit to 1-3 year Reserved Instances (RIs) or Savings Plans.

## 3. Auto-Scaling

All stateless workloads (API servers, web servers) should reside in Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs).

- Scale out dynamically based on load (e.g., 70% CPU utilization).
- Scale down during off-peak hours to minimize idle resource costs.

## 4. Storage & Data Transfer Optimization

- Move infrequent access data to Amazon S3 Standard-IA or Glacier.
- Optimize database storage and enable automated minor version upgrades.
- Minimize cross-region data transfer by deploying resources in a single primary region (`us-east-1`).
- Use VPC Endpoints (PrivateLink) to avoid NAT Gateway data processing charges for AWS service API calls.

## 5. Monitoring & Alerting

We use a centralized cost monitoring setup:

- **AWS Budgets**: Configured via Terraform (`infra/aws-cost-management/main.tf`) to alert when costs exceed 80% of our monthly budget or if forecasted costs exceed 100%.
- **Cost Explorer Anomaly Detection**: Configured to notify the DevOps team immediately of any unexpected cost spikes.
- **Cost Analyzer Script**: A weekly scheduled GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/aws-cost-monitoring.yml`) runs `scripts/aws_cost_analyzer.py` to fetch current cost trends and highlight Compute Optimizer recommendations.

## 6. Action Items for the Team

- Always apply standard tags to your resources.
- Regularly review the Cost Optimization Dashboard.
- Delete or stop sandbox/testing resources when not in use.
